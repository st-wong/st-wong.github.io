#### Game Developer, Tools
*January 2005 â€“ July 2005*  
*Cyberjaya, Malaysia*

##### Internal Version Control
There was some file sync needed between the Development team and Graphics team since the artists had a hard time using SVN.
I developed a simple version control to allow files to be sync and downloaded between the 2 departments in real time.

##### Camera Export Tool
The tool developers needed to get different camera view while developing their extensions for the game.
I created a camera export tool which allow the tool developers to view the game at various angles.
