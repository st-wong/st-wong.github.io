#### Senior Software Engineer, Team Lead
*June 2017 – April 2019*  
*Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia*

##### Training Framework
Blockchain technology was a paradigm shift for many people in 2017 and the concept of decentralization was something many people were interested to understand but were misinformed.
I lead the technical team in the APAC region to develop the training framework and certification process, to educate the public about this new technology and saw that it was a good opportunity to prepare the foundation for generating revenue.
The team trained many developers globally on the concepts of blockchain and it's use cases, giving guidance on how solutions can be built on this technology.
The team was instrumental in the entire certification process from details on what should be in the certification to cost calculation on each certification course.
We eventually were the main team that helped generate [revenue](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-foundation-update-june-2019/22980) for the entire foundation.

##### Exchange Integration
NEM has it's own cryptocurrency called XEM which was used to fund transactions on the NEM blockchain, and exchanges would list them to allow people to trade the cryptocurrency.
I lead the team to support most (if not all) of the exchanges in the technical [integration](https://st-wong.github.io/NEMExchangeSupport/) and adviced on security measures that the exchanges should be aware of.
