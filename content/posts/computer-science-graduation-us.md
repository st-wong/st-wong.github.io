##### **Auction site**
I had the opportunity to work in an e-commerce company in which I developed an auction site using Perl & MySQL.
The site was a prototype and was meant to allow consumers to bid for fresh vegetables directly from the farmers.
Concurrent bids was something that would typically happen during a bid, in which I developed a simple queue system to help in dealing with conflict bids.
