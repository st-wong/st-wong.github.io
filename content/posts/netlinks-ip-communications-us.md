##### 3D Game Engine
Determine to get into the game industry, I started writing my own 3D game engine during my own time.
The engine was never completed unfortunately, but I did complete the terrain rendering and collision detection modules.
I also realized the importance of calculus and linear algebra during my journey in developing this engine.
