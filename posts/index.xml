Internal Version Control There was some file sync needed between the Development team and Graphics team since the artists had a hard time using SVN. I developed a simple version control to allow files to be sync and downloaded between the 2 departments in real time.
Camera Export Tool The tool developers needed to get different camera view while developing their extensions for the game.</description>

3D Game Engine Determine to get into the game industry, I started writing my own 3D game engine during my own time. The engine was never completed unfortunately, but I did complete the terrain rendering and collision detection modules. I also realized the importance of calculus and linear algebra during my journey in developing this engine.</description>

Auction site I had the opportunity to work in an e-commerce company in which I developed an auction site using Perl &amp;amp; MySQL. The site was a prototype and was meant to allow consumers to bid for fresh vegetables directly from the farmers. Concurrent bids was something that would typically happen during a bid, in which I developed a simple queue system to help in dealing with conflict bids.</description>
