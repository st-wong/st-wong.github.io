3D Game Engine Determine to get into the game industry, I started writing my own 3D game engine during my own time. The engine was never completed unfortunately, but I did complete the terrain rendering and collision detection modules. I also realized the importance of calculus and linear algebra during my journey in developing this engine.</description>

The site was a prototype and was meant to allow consumers to bid for fresh vegetables directly from the farmers. Concurrent bids was something that would typically happen during a bid, in which I developed a simple queue system to help in dealing with conflict bids.</description>
